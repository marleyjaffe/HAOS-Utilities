# Z-Wave JS Entity Mapping Template
# 
# - Provide mappings for each entity belonging to your original device.
# - For entities you wish to skip, leave target_entity as null or remove the entry.
# - To perform a 1:1 rename, provide the desired new entity_id.
# 
# Example for a 4-port switch mapping to a 2-port replacement:
#
# mappings:
#   - current_entity: switch.old_switch_switch_1
#     target_entity: switch.new_switch_switch_1
#   - current_entity: switch.old_switch_switch_2
#     target_entity: switch.new_switch_switch_2
#   - current_entity: switch.old_switch_switch_3
#     target_entity:  # <--- Skipped (no new port available)
#   - current_entity: switch.old_switch_switch_4
#     target_entity:  # <--- Skipped

mappings:
  - current_entity: 
    target_entity: 
  # Add additional mapping lines for each entity as needed
